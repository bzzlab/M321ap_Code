Study case:
'agnhost netexec' server as little Swiss-army for networking tests

Read the code comments and fill the gaps in the bash-script to obtain
networking testing tool.
General usage is: ./test-netexec.sh <EXTERNAL-IP> <PORT>

Example: ./test-netexec.sh 192.168.49.2 32045
Or if using minikube tunnel with LoadBalancer:
./test-netexec.sh 127.0.0.1 8080

Run it with your Minikube IP & NodePort:
./test-netexec.sh $(minikube ip) 32045
(replace 32045 with your actual NodePort)

Remark: In order to program this script you need
to read all articles in 05/01_Intro/* and REVIEW them in
your K8s cluster before completing this task. Thus
you gain a better understanding of the task.
