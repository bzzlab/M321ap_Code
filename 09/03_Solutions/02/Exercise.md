## Exercise: Test the shutdown / self-heal behaviour
### Task
1. Create a K8s declaration by filling the missing gaps 
in the cluster.yaml file. The purpose is to create an exposed service by using the pushed image from your registry.
2. Create a simple management tool for the cluster by filling the missing gaps in the cluster.yaml file. This tool will enhance your work with your service in the cluster.  
3. Execute/Test all on your AWS account.
4. Check the self-heal behaviour of your cluster when calling the endpoint /shutdown.
